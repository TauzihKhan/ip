# PotatoBot UI Test Plan

This plan is consumed by `skills/test-ui/scripts/run_ui_tests.py`. Each test case starts with an empty task list. Steps within a test case share state and are checked in order.

The runner requires Java 25, builds before testing, compares each PotatoBot reply exactly after normalizing line endings and surrounding whitespace, prints the console input/output record, and stops at the first failure. A test case can provide its starting save-file content through `initial_save_file`.
